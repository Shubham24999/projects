## Props
- Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.

## State
- The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

## useState API
- The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components . so basically useState is the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component.

## MAP
- The maps are used for traversing or displaying the list of similar objects of a component. The map method is a standard JavaScript function and not just a ReactJs feature that could be called on an array. A new array is made using the map() method, and a function is called on each element of the array.


## FILTER
- The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements. The filter() method does not change the original array.

## REDUCE
- The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
